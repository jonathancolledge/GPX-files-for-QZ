# GPX-files-for-QZ
A library of GPX files for indoor training using QZ (Qdomyos-zwift)

Cycling files are smooth, without abnormal gradients, and the elevation data have been transferred from LiDAR based digital elevation models. Original files, to be published elsewhere, consisted of data points spaced at 1 m or less. In order to save space, these files have been simplified whilst maintaining overall elevation gain.

Swimming files (for use with QZ and the KayakPro Swimfast Ergo, other KayakPro, or the Whipr) can be used for kayaking, SUP, or short rowing workouts. The elevation data are corrected with either the lake surface elevation or sea level.

Rowing files are similar to the above. RGT GPX extensions have been used to mark race course segments.

Nordic skiing files will be processed in the same manner. The Vasaloppet file will have the majority of the elevation data provided by LiDAR, but the initial part is an elevation map made of barometric data from multiple GPX files that have been corrected to the first LiDAR based point.
